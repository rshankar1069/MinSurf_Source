## Mesh Parameters

# ~ Number of gridpoints per dimension
# --> Have thus noMeshElements^2 elements
noMeshElements 800 

## Constants (apart from "pi", "e" and "i")
## Append '$' in the front of the constant to pass it to the expression parser

NUM_CONSTS 1

$OMEGA 1

## Variables (CASE SENSITIVE)
# x,y \in [0,1] on the grid 

NUM_VARS 2

VAR0 x
VAR1 y

## Boundary Conditions
#  Use constants with '$' sign to pass the expression to the parser 
#  If you want piece-wise boundary conditions: 
#   We implemented the functions smaller1(VAR), larger1(VAR) in the parser
#   smaller1(VAR) { (VAR<=1)? 1:0 } and larger1(VAR) { (VAR>=1)? 1:0 }
#   Make sure to scale VAR such that one compares to 1


BC.BOTTOM  1 #sin($pi*x) 
BC.RIGHT   1 #sin($pi*y)
BC.TOP     1 #sin($pi*x)
BC.LEFT    0 #sin($pi*y)

## Tuning Parameters
