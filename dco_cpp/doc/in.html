 (see <a href="#contact">Section 6</a> for contact details).

        <!-- 3.1. Contents -->

<h4><a name="contents">3.1. Contents</a></h4>

The following shows the folder and file organization of the implementation
materials after installation:

<pre>
            |- doc -|- in.html  (Installer's Note - this document)
            |       |- userguide.pdf (User Guide as pdf)
            |       |- licence -|- *  (licence management documentation)
	    |
	    |- bin -|- (licence management tools)
dcl6i34ngl -|

        <!-- 4. Installation -->

<h3><a name="installation">4. Installation</a></h3>

        <!-- 4.1. Normal Installation -->

<h4><a name="dcoinst">4.1. Normal Installation</a></h4>
<p>
Assuming you have downloaded the dco/c++ installer from our website, extract the installation materials using the following command:
</p>
<pre>
  tar xvzf dcl6i34ngl.tgz
</pre>
<p>
This will extract the files install.sh, dcl6i34ngl.tar.gz and nag_tsandcs.txt.
</p>
<p>
You can then install the materials from the download directory by executing the shell script install.sh in a command window as:
</p>
<pre>
  ./install.sh
</pre>

<p>
By default, the dco/c++ materials are installed in
<pre>
  ${HOME}/NAG/dcl6i34ngl
</pre>
or the equivalent for your locale.


        <!-- 4.2. Silent Installation -->

<h4><a name="silent">4.2. Silent Installation</a></h4>

It is also possible to run <tt>install.sh</tt>
in unattended or silent modes. The installer takes command
line switches for this purpose:
<ul>
  <li><tt>-silent</tt>
    <br>
    means perform a silent installation.  In this case, the <tt>-accept</tt> and
     <tt>-installdir</tt> switches must also be used
  <li><tt>-accept</tt>
    <br>
    means that you accept the NAG licence agreement
  <li><tt>-installdir=DIR</tt>
    <br>
    means that the library will be installed under directory <tt>DIR</tt>
</ul>


        <!-- 4.3. Licence Management -->

<h4><a name="licence">4.3. Licence Management</a></h4>

The use of this product is controlled by the Kusari licence
management system. This release of dco/c++ uses version
2.2-88 of Kusari.

<p>
In order to enable the software, NAG will issue you with a licence key.
The licence key is contained in a text file consisting of details of
the software that will be enabled.
For evaluation purposes a trial licence may be used.

For more details on how to install the licence, please see respective subdirectory after installation.
        <!-- 5. Example Programs -->

<h4><a name="examples">5. Example Programs</a></h4>

Access to the dco/c++ materials can be checked by running a few example
programs following the advice given below.
(Detailed documentation on dco/c++ and examples is located in the User Guide
which can be found in the
<tt>dcl6i34ngl/doc</tt>
directory).

<h4><a name="commandline">5.1. Running from a 
     command line</a></h4>
        <!-- 5.1. DOS command line -->
<ul>
  <li> Open a command line
  <li> Go to the examples directory and type <tt>make</tt>
    to compile and run all the
    available examples from the user guide
  <li> To run examples individually, change to a subdirectory containing the example
    you are interested in and type <tt>make</tt>
    to compile and run that example
</ul>

The output of the <tt>make</tt> command shows the compilation and link
options used to produce each executable program. In addition, results of
running the program are compared with reference results. Note that there
may be small differences between observed and reference results, depending
on the environment.
<p>
More sophisticated examples (case studies) are located in folders
<ul>
  <li> case_studies\diffusion
  <li> case_studies\mc
  <li> case_studies\pde
  <li> case_studies\race
</ul>
To run all these examples change directory to the <tt>case_studies</tt> folder
and type <tt>make</tt>. This will compile all examples located in the folder.
Again, to run an example individually change to a
subdirectory with the example of your choice and type <tt>make</tt>.
